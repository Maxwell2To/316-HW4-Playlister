## Overview
This repository is to be used for Stony Brook University's CSE 316, Fall 2025 Semester, Homework 4. This assignment is similar to HWs 1 - 3 in that we are creating a similar application, but this time we're adding some unit testing, changing the database, and doing a bit of abstraction/redesign regarding how our back-end talks to the database.

All assignment instructions are provided <a href='https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse316/HW4.html'>here</a>.
